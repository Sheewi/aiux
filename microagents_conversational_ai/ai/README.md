# AI (Conversational, Planning, and Comprehension)

This folder contains all scripts and modules related to user-facing AI, including:
- Conversational logic and dialogue management
- Planning and intent recognition
- Comprehension and user input understanding
- Chat UI and user interaction

**No microagent or agent registry logic should be placed here.**

Integration with microagents should occur via middleware or orchestrator modules (e.g., in `tokenizer/` or a dedicated `orchestrator/` folder).
